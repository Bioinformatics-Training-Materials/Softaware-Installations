### Installation

1. [Download Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your specific OS to your home directory
    - Linux: `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    - Mac: `curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
2. Run:
    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
3. Follow all the prompts: if unsure, accept defaults
4. Close and re-open your terminal
5. If the installation is successful, you should see a list of installed packages with
    - `conda list`
If the command cannot be found, you can add Anaconda bin to the path using:
    ` export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH`

For reproducible analysis, you can [create a conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with all the Python packages you used.

    `conda create --name eneza python jupyter`
    
To activate the conda environment:
    `source activate eneza`

Having set-up conda environment, you can install `jupyter lab` using pip. 

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

or by using pip

`pip3 install jupyter`
Then you can quickly launch jupyter lab using:

`jupyter lab`

NB: We will use a jupyter lab for training. 
A Jupyter notebook is made up of many cells. Each cell can contain Python code. You can execute a cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift-Enter` or `Ctrl-Enter` (run without moving to the next line). 

## For Windows
Follow the instructions available [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
